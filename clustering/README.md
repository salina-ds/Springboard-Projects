# Clustering Mini Project  

## Overview

Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

Analyze data from wine vendor. Data includes wine offers and customer purchases.  
  
Explore data with K-means Clustering. 

Explore clusters using PCA.  

Explore relationship between raw data and clusters. Tell a story about the fit.   

Explore additional clustering algorithms and compare results with K-means.   

### Findings  

Poor results with K-means.   

PCA suggests 3 clusters, but overlap of clusters, difficult to correlate clusters to original data.  

Additional clustering algorithms also have challenges finding clusters in data.
