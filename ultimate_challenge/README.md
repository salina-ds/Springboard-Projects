# Ultimate Challenge  

1. Aggregate user logins from JSON file based on 15 minute time intervals. Visualize and describe the resulting time series of login counts in ways that characterize the underlying patterns of demand. Report/illustrate features of the demand, such as daily cycles. Report any data quality issues.    

Strong weekly pattern, daily pattern. Some data quality issues. 

2. Create an experiment to encourage driver partners to serve two cities separated by a toll bridge by reimbursing toll costs.   
a. How would you implement the experiment?   
b. What statistical tests would you conduct?  
c. How would you interpret the results?   

Assign subset of drivers to get reimbursed, another subset not reimbursed. Run test for several weeks due to weekly traffic pattern. Use t-test to compare proportion of tolls to rides. Also compare mean profits. 

3. Create a model to predict rider retention from six months of rider data.   
a. Perform cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations of the data.   
b. Build a predictive model to determine whether or not a rider will be active in their 6th month.  
c. Discuss how Ultimate, Inc. might leverage the insights gained from the model.    

Main factor in rider retention is number of trips in first 30 days, percent of rides during weekdays, average distance per trip in first 30 days.
