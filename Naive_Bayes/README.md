# Naive Bayes Mini Project

Use Naive Bayes to categorize movie reviews. 

Use MultinomialNB with CountVectorizer.  
Find features that predict how reviews will be classified.  

Compare TF-IDF to CountVectorizer results. 

### Findings  

Multinomial Naive Bayes with TF-IDF using ngrams = single words and bigrams yielded the best results.   

Naive Bayes with CountVectorizer performed almost as well.   

Best model test accuracy was 0.77 with F1-Score of 0.83.
