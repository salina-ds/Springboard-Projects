# Relax Take Home Challenge  

Define an "adopted user" as a user who has logged in three separate days in at 
least one seven day period. Identify which factors predict user adoption.  

Two data files:   

* User demographics, very limited  
* User login history  

No factors found. Most users did not login three times. Those that did were very likely to become adopted users. No demographics correlated with logging in three or more times. Relax, Inc. needs to track more user data to find how to predict user adoption.
